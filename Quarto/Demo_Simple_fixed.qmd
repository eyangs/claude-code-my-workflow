# Introduction

## What is Causal Inference?

::: definition
**Definition:** Causal inference is process of drawing conclusions about causal relationships based on observed data [@Angrist2009_mostly_harmless].
:::

::: keybox
**Key Question:** What would have happened to Y if we had changed X by one unit, while holding everything else constant?

## Why Causal Inference Matters

- **Policy Evaluation:** Understanding effect of interventions
- **Scientific Discovery:** Identifying causal mechanisms
- **Decision Making:** Making informed choices under uncertainty

**Example:** Does taking a drug actually cure disease, or is it just correlation?

# Core Concepts

## Potential Outcomes Framework

Let $Y_{1i}$ and $Y_{0i}$ denote potential outcomes for unit $i$:

$$
\begin{align*}
Y_{1i} &= \text{Outcome if treated} \\
Y_{0i} &= \text{Outcome if not treated}
\end{align*}
$$

The causal effect for unit $i$ is:

$$ \tau_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} $$

*Problem: We can only observe one of these for each unit!*

## Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

The average causal effect across population:

$$ \text{ATE} = \mathbb{E}[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}] $$

**Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference:**

We cannot observe $Y_{1i}$ and $Y_{0i}$ simultaneously for same unit $i$.
